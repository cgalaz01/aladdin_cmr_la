# Supplements - Aladdin: High-Resolution Maps of Left Atrial Displacements and Strains Estimated with 3D CINE MRI

## Data Example
| ![cross_section](supplements/data_example.png "Cross section view and volume across the cardiac cycle") | 
|:--:|
| *SupFig 1. The cross-sectional view of the left atrium (LA) (top) and the volume across the cardiac cycle (bottom) of a representative healthy case, acquired using the proposed high-resolution 3D MRI protocol. * |


## Registration Results
| ![la_reg](supplements/la_reg.gif "Left atrium registration results across the cardiac cycle") | 
|:--:|
| *SupAni 1. The image registration results across the cardiac cycle for a representative case are shown. Each row displays a slice of the resulting registration for the models: ANTs, Vxm-seg, Vxm, and Aladdin-R, respectively. The plots illustrate the volume, Dice score, and Hausdorff distance achieved by each of the models. * |

|:--:|
| *SupAni 2. Comparison of the estimated displacement vector fields achieved, from left to right, by Aladdin-R, ANTs, Vxm, and Vxm-seg, respectively, across the cardiac cycle. * |


## Atlas
